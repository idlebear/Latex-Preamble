# Latex Preamble

This repo is a work in progress. The goal is to automate and simplify some of the more common Latex functions that I find myself using as I write academic papers.   There are also a few quality of life functions 
to make the editing process a little easier.  Examples and limited explanations can be found in *main.tex*.

## Usage

* Install or otherwise copy *preamble.sty* to your working tex directory. 
* Add *\usepackage{preamble} to the top of your .tex file.

And that's it.  You should be good to go.
